#Mixed Messages

##Overview
Mixed Messages is a Codecademy project that should output a random message each time the program is run.

##Goal (prior to coding)
+ The app should output a random message composed of at least three seperate phrases
+ The program will be run from the terminal (I have not yet learned how to integrate HTML and JS together)
+ Messages will be insults to the user (inspired by the Maurader's Map in Harry Potter), encouraging them to mind their own business

## Message Components
1. The user's name
2. An adjective of exhortation (urge, encourage, beg, exhort, ect...)
3. An adjective describing a body part (large, greasy, flabby, ect...)
4. A body part

#### Structure
We {adjective of exhortation} {user's name} to keep their {adjective describing a body part} {body part} out of other peoples business.
